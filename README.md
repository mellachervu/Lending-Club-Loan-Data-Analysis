# Lending Club Loan Data Analysis

Lending Club, Inc. is a US based company which offers platform for borrowers to obtain loans from investors, where the investors receive interest payments based on invested loans. As with any lending practices, there is always a certain percent of loans that get defaulted/charged off. The confidence in lenders to invest in loans through a platform largely depends on the amount of risk there exists for a loan getting charged off. Thus, the chance of a loan being defaulted by a borrower is an extremely important attribute that could help in increasing investor confidence and consequently higher loan investment through the platform, profiting the company.
The project aims to obtain the likelihood of a loan being charged off by identifying various factors related to the past borrowers by building a predictive model. Further, we also plan to estimate the amount of loan that is reasonable to give to a borrower based on said characteristics. Through these predictions, investor confidence and reliance on the company could increase due to the notion of minimized risk of loan delinquency.
